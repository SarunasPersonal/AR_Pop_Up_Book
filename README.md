<h1>Ar Pop Up Book For Kids</h1>

<h2>About the Book</h2>
<p>The book tells a story about a bee, named Sheila. Sheila travels across fields and forests to see hot air balloons in Bristol.</p>
<h2>Book Contents</h2>
<p>The AR book contains four pages. Each page is narrated. The majority of assets were created by me, Sarunas.</p>
<h2>User Testing</h2>
<p>Book was tested by two 29-month-old toddlers. Toddlers were engaged at the time. Four paper pages were printed, which led toddlers' imaginations to roam. </p>

<h2>Background Pages</h2>
<P>There is an example of a page. The QR code on the right-hand side must be scanned to open the AR; then, a scene must be aligned within a scene picture on the device screen. Once everything is aligned, the science comes alive, and the Tap button shows up. This is where the story begins. </P>
